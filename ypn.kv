# This file uses size_hint for a dynamic layout that'll look okay on different
# screens. size_hint is a way of saying, "the page's horizontal space should be
# 15 parts this element and 85 parts this element." Although the specs allow
# use of any numbers the developer likes, we'll stick with treating the numbers
# as out of 100, for consistency and ease of visualization.
# Please make sure your code complies with this standard.
