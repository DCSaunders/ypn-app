# ^^^ This thing is important. Don't delete it.
# The classes defined in brackets are just classes. This widget here actually
# tells the interpreter to display the root widget, which starts off showing
# the Calendar page but can be cleared to display other stuff.
# If you delete it, you'll get a blank screen.
# If you replace it with the name of another widget, that one will display
# instead, which can be a useful debugging tool. Otherwise, don't touch!
# It's defined just below.

    # yet, so it's probably worth waiting a bit to code this piece.
    # If they don't come out with documentation as soon as we'd like, we can
    # read the source--but it's not currently a high enough priority to focus
    # on this yet.

    # You have to specify there's a YpnHeader widget at the top of every Page

    # a Page class that the other pages inherit from) lets you omit the header
    # on certain pages if you choose. On the one hand, DRY, but on the other,
    # inheritance is not a panacea, and this is probably the best method since
    # it lends us a bit of flexibility in exchange for repeating one short,
    # easily-understood line of code.

    # NOTE FOR NEWBIES TO KIVY who are trying to work on this code
    # Making this functional will mean some more complex logic stuff over in

    # tapped. If I remember right, whenever you need to do processing on user
    # data in a particular element or whatever, you need to import the
    # appropriate Kivy widgets/layouts/whatever you're using into your Python
    # code file and write the logic there.
    #
    # That's not to deter you from learning how this works and trying to code
    # it--this note is just to steer you in the right direction. Just remember:
    # logic goes in the Python code, display definitions go in the kvlang file.
