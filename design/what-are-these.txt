This directory, as initially committed, has eight images and two (other) text
files in it. The images are from the initial mobile app class when we did the
design, which was approved by the customer. The text files are schedule- and
spec-related files from meetings with the customer. Basically, they're my notes
and I wasn't expecting to use them beyond the class, but here we are. They
should still be fairly useful to you; I may come back later and tweak them in
case parts are kind of hard to understand out of context.
